# Loyalty Checkin
This monorepo contains a client and server.  
More information can be found in each individual repo.
You'll need to have both the client and the server running at the same time for it to work.

## Client
View the readme for this Angular 5 application [here](client/README.md).
`cd` into this direction and follow the readme.  Run `ng server` to get the server up and running.

## Server
View the readme for this KOA NodeJS application [here](server/README.md).
`cd` into this direction and follow the readme.  Run `npm run watch` to get the server up and running.
